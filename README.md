## im not okay
### last year my dad told me i will be doing engineering. i didnt say nothin. he say i should code. 
i didnt know what it meant so i asked my friend(hes so cool) and he handed me a packet of some white medicines called codeine. 
this is fun as hell, didnt know dad was cool like that.
now i do codiene on a daily and its so much fun. also for some reason people told  me i should do code on this website idk why.
they asked me if i do code daily and i said hell yeah and im pretty good at it. they started asking me about some project(?)
well i dont know what they meant but they did suggest i open a github account this way i can share my codiene skill with others.
well if thts the case then i surely will help.
i code in c and python btw
